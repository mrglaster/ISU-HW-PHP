### Exercise 1

         1) member name,
         2) last name
         3) email address
         4) contact phone
         5) conference topics of interest:
             5.1) Business,
             5.2) Technologies,
             5.3) Advertising and Marketing,
         6) preferred payment method for participation:
             6.1) Webmoney
             6.2) Yandex money
             6.3) PayPal,
             6.4) Credit Card
         7) specify about his desire to receive mailing about the conference.
     
  Accept the client's data, check that all fields are filled in.
  In case of an error, inform the user about it (while already entered data should not be lost).
  If there are no errors, save the received data to a file (you can also make a note about the date and time the application was sent).
  The file name must be unique so that the next request does not overwrite the existing one.
  Notify the user that his application has been successfully accepted.

### Exercise 2

Create a separate page for the administrator, where you could see all the applications left in the form of a list.  Assume that you do not need to close the page with an administrator password.
Provide the ability to select one or more applications (checkboxes) for their deletion by clicking the "Delete" button, which will send a form with a list of marked applications to be deleted.
